# brevet-time-calculator

Multiple container-based web apps to practice full-stack software engineering. The sequence was architected incrementally as individual excercises learning new tools, frameworks, and software applications

## About This Repo

* Each sub-directory is a stand-alone container-based web app mini-project

* Each sub-directory contains it's own READMEâ€”which goes into great detail of the technical objectives and lessons learned/applied, as well as what the mini-project does and step-by-step instructions for how to use it

* `v4-brevets` was built as the foundation for an "end goal" web app, and is the result of concepts learned from developing `v1-pageserver`, `v2-docker_flask`, and `v3-ajax`

* `v5-mongo` and `v6-rest` further enhance functionality of `v4-brevets` with database storage and RESTful web API design, respectively
